# Fabu's Mod

A decompilation of Fabu's Mod, updated to run on Terraria 1.4. Due to the nature of decompiling .NET binaries, this is not a perfect recreation and is incompatible with world that previously used Fabu's Mod.

#### Requirements

There are a few things you'll need to use this:

* Terraria 1.4
* [tModLoader](https://tmodloader.net/)

#### Downloading

All releases can be found in [Releases](https://git.theduckpond.club/big-duckie/FabusMod/releases)

#### Building

If you wish to build this from source, just open the .sln in Visual Studio 2022.

#### FAQ

* Is this official?

No. This decompilation and port is completely unofficial. There currently isn't an official update for Fabu's Mod to TML 1.4. It is unlikely this will happen, as Fabu hasn't been heard from in over a year. This also served as a good lesson in .NET decompilation, and TML modding.

* Will this be on Steam Workshop?

Maybe. There are quite a few things that I need to fix first, and quite a bit of polish that needs to be done to make it ready for the public. One day it might be ready to release to the public. On the upside, if I cannot solve some major game breaking bug, this version is open source, so if anyone else can fix it, they can release it.

* I am Fabu, and I would like this taken down.

Fair enough. Email me at bd(at)bigduckie(dot)me, and let me know. If you're fine with this staying up, feel free to email me anyways. Only Fabu though. I DO NOT do tech support through email. Issues and bugs go in the issue tracker above.
