This is an unoffical update to TML 1.4. Please report any bugs you find to the issue tracker linked below.

Fabu's Mod is a little Terraria Mod made with tModloader, which adds weapons that the player can upgrade as they progress in the game.
It also adds some new and unique weapons, which have surprisingly in-depth features.

There are several items that you can craft in the beginning, and keep upgrading until post-Moon Lord.

It currently adds:
- 81 new weapons (With 14 different dyed variants for some weapons!)
- 11 new items
- 2 new tiles
- 1 new vanity sets (+ 3 Fox Ears!)
- 4 new tools; 1 Pickaxe, 1 Digging Claw, 1 Axe, and 1 Hamaxe
- 2 new pets
- 11 new accessories
Keep in mind that this mod is still a work-in-progress, and if anything seems unfinished or unrefined, there is a high chance that it will be finished/refined in a future update.

Credit for a lot of the sprites goes to KregJoke.
